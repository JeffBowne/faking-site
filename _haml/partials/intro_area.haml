        I built this site with Haml, Sass, and jQuery - using partial file structure for both markup and stylesheets - untilizing BEM namespacing and elements of ITCSS - using Jekyll as a framework. 

        -# I used Jekyll as a simple framework so that I could host the site on GitHub Pages but I had to tweek some things in order to use HAML. Jekyll does work with HAML via plugins, but GitHub Pages does not support those plugins, so I wrote a ruby class that runs a compiler locally whenever I modify a haml file and spits out the resulting html files into the parent directory for Jekyll to process before I commit the result.
