FAKING is some kind of noise-rock trio from Philly that bridges the gap between the brooding filth of Amphetamine Reptile Records and the angular aggression of Dischord Records, spanning influences from the mathy side of the Chicago scene to the most abrasive output of Seattle. Giant pounding drums, crackling bass throb, and buzz saw guitar riffs that bleed into reverb drenched seasick leads create the foundation while vocals scream and holler about shitty people doing shitty things.

Picking up where their Reptilian Records released previous bands left off are local ugly-music veterans Jeff Bowne from Gunna Vahm on guitar/vocals and Phil Schorn from Gunna Vahm/Midiron Blast Shaft on drums, along with Matt Garfield from Mose Giganticus on bass/synth.
