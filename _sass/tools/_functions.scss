/**
 * px-to-percent
 *
 * Allows a percentage to be calculated based on two pixel values. Useful when
 * a developer is trying to preserve the presentation of a component while the
 * browser window is being scrolled.
 *
 * The first argument should be the desired width of an element within it's
 * container at a known size. The second argument should be that container's
 * known size.
 *
 * The values supplied should be unitless. Example: `px-to-percent(100, 300)`
 *
 * This would produce a percentage width for an element of ~100px when it's
 * immediate container is ~300px.
